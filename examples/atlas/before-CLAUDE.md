# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

**v1 is built** (Next.js App Router + Prisma 7 + libSQL/Turso + Auth.js v5). All 10 feature phases are implemented and verified locally; deployment to Vercel + Turso is the remaining step (see [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)).

### Commands
- `npm run dev` — dev server (needs Node on PATH; installed at `C:\Program Files\nodejs`).
- `npm run build` — production build + full typecheck (use this as the check; there is no test suite yet).
- `npm run lint` — ESLint.
- `npm run db:migrate` — `prisma migrate dev` (local `file:` DB). **After a migration, restart `npm run dev`** — the running server caches the old generated client and will throw validation errors on new fields until bounced.
- `npm run db:seed` — seed user + default groups/categories (reads `ADMIN_EMAIL`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD`).
- `npm run db:studio` — Prisma Studio.

### Key implementation facts
- **Prisma 7 specifics**: no `url` in `schema.prisma` (connection is in `prisma.config.ts` via `datasource.url`); runtime uses the **libSQL driver adapter** (`lib/prisma.ts`), Rust-engine-free. Compound-unique where-keys are named like `userId_year_month`.
- **SQLite has no enums** — `kind`/`status`/`frequency`/`direction` are `String` columns backed by `lib/constants.ts` + zod (`lib/validations.ts`).
- **Money math** lives in `lib/cash.ts` (`computeMonthSummary`); recurring generation in `lib/recurring.ts` (called from `app/(app)/layout.tsx`). Auth is split: `lib/auth.config.ts` (edge-safe, used by `proxy.ts`) + `lib/auth.ts` (Node, Credentials+bcrypt).
- **Routes** (all under `app/(app)/`): `/` dashboard, `/known`, `/expenses`, `/people`, `/funds`, `/history`, `/recurring`, `/categories`; `/login` is public. Middleware is `proxy.ts` (Next 16 renamed `middleware`→`proxy`).
- Local dev password is `atlas-dev-1234` (in gitignored `.env`); production password is set at seed time.

## What This Project Is

**ATLAS** (**A**daptive **T**racking & **L**edger **A**nalysis **S**ystem) is a personal finance tracker (single user for v1) for logging expense/income transactions and planning a monthly budget, accessed from multiple devices via a hosted web app. "Adaptive" refers to the budget pre-fill feature, which bases next month's plan on last month's actuals.

## Source-of-truth docs (read before implementation)
- **[PRD.md](PRD.md)** — requirements, feature scope, rationale.
- **[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md)** — **authoritative** data model (Prisma schema), money model, and screen designs. Reflects the user's real plan-then-reconcile workflow.
- **[IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)** — scaffolding, Turso, Auth, folder structure, recurring-generation, deployment. **Its §2 (schema) and §9 (build order) are superseded by DESIGN.md** — use DESIGN.md for those.

Don't duplicate the content of those docs here.

## Confirmed Tech Stack (from PRD.md §8)

- **Next.js + TypeScript** — single app, frontend + API routes together.
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- **Prisma + Turso** (hosted SQLite-compatible DB) for persistence.
- **Auth.js (NextAuth)** with a Credentials provider, backed by a `User` table (email + bcrypt password hash) and session cookies.
- **Hosting: Vercel free tier.**

Currency is fixed to INR (₹); no multi-currency support. Cost constraint: keep the stack on free tiers wherever possible — avoid introducing paid infra.

## Key Architectural Decisions to Preserve

- **Single-user now, multi-user-ready later:** a real `User` table with hashed passwords and session-based auth is used even though v1 has exactly one user row. Don't replace this with a shared-password/env-var shortcut — the whole point is that v2 multi-user support should only require adding rows + ownership columns, not a rewrite of auth.
- **Plan-then-reconcile workflow:** known expenses are *planned* line items with a `status` (pending/paid/skipped) that the user ticks off — not just after-the-fact logging. Discretionary spends are logged as `paid` directly. Don't collapse this back into a flat "all transactions already happened" model.
- **Recurring transactions are templates, not cron-copied rows:** a `RecurringTransaction` template generates `Transaction` rows each month (as `pending` for known/savings items), linked back via `recurringSourceId`. Generated transactions are then independently editable. Generation is **lazy (on page load), not a cron job.**
- **Discretionary budget is a manual cap, not the cash math:** the monthly budget is a self-imposed discretionary spending target (pre-filled from last month's discretionary actual), shown as spent/cap. It does not feed the cash calculation.
- **Person ledger is part of the cash math:** money received from people (non-pending) is money-in, money given is money-out. `RemainingCash = (income + additional + carryIn + received) − (knownPaid + discretionary + given)`, and carries forward to next month. See [UI_DESIGN_GUIDE.md](UI_DESIGN_GUIDE.md) §7.
- **Savings & funds are a snapshot, not cash flow:** the `Fund` list (editable balances) is a net-position view only and must not be mixed into the monthly remaining-cash math.
- **Money as integer paise:** amounts are `Int` (paise), never `Float`/`Decimal` — SQLite has no Prisma `Decimal` support and `Float` risks rounding errors.
- **No raw SQLite file:** the DB is Turso (hosted), not a local `.db` file, because Vercel's filesystem is ephemeral and a local SQLite file would not survive redeploys.

## Data Model (see DESIGN.md for the authoritative Prisma schema)

`User` (with openingBalance), `CategoryGroup` (2-level, carries kind), `Category`, `Transaction` (with status), `RecurringTransaction`, `Budget` (discretionary cap), `Person` + `PersonLedgerEntry`, `Fund` (lightweight savings snapshot). No multi-currency field, no multi-account/wallet entity in v1; full investment tracking (returns/history) is v2.

## UI / visual spec

The Dashboard is a single-page **worksheet** (see [UI_DESIGN_GUIDE.md](UI_DESIGN_GUIDE.md), derived from the approved mockup in `Mockup designs/`). Muted-teal palette + clay accent, Plus Jakarta Sans, tabular numerals, **Indian digit grouping** (`1,20,000` not `120,000`), minus sign U+2212. Other screens reuse the same tokens/components. The `.dc.html` files are references — do not port their `support.js` runtime.
